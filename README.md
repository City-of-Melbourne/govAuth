GovCore is information management system to run councils.

It tries to address these problems:

- Satisfying audit
- Supporting flexibility and continuous improvement
- Resilience and scale in deployment options
- Onboarding new functions and organisations (data migration)
- Managing attachments like images, documents and records
- Embedding spatial mapping
- Managing roles and responsibilities
- Adopting international and industry standards
- Satisfying records management obligations

Read the [GovCore Concept](docs/govcore.md) for a more detailed description.

## About the Project

This project is the first attempt to realise Simons's vision of GovCore.

It was a six-week experiment ran at the City Of Melbourne by [CodeForAustralia](https://codeforaustralia.org/) fellows Jonathan Castillo Bello and Victor Nava under the guidance and support of Simon Weller, Daniella Mazzone and Colin Fairweather.

The main goal of the project was to demonstrate that:

1. A system following GovCore principles could be built
2. Such system is a good option for building of apps for council

To achieve that, we built these prototypes:

- [GovCore](govcore/): JSON Document/Template store accesible via HTTP API
- [GovAuth](govauth/): An authorization system for CoM clients to login into CoM services.
- [GovBox](govbox/): Web client to manage/explore GovCore

[TODO: diagram of what we built and how it's connected]

TODO: that was the result?

## TODO: Spec (Blueprint)

TODO: put on a separate document?

Define distill the GovCore Way...

The [GovCore Concept](docs/govcore.md) sets the Vision/Goals. We need to go down one level and specify the concept in more detail. We need to include enough information to able to implement GovCore in any platform/database/language.

GovCore stores its data in key/value pair documents in human readable format.

GovCore is composed of layers:

- Rest API
- Access Control
- Workflow Management/Runner
- Data Store Logic
- Data Store Adapters (Document, Graph and Log)

## Implementation Notes

TODO: Review focus on GovCore/GovAuth
